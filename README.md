# Note Taker

This challenge is for module 11 of UMO coding bootcamp.

## Description

This project allows the user to read, write, and delete notes.

## Objective

The purpose of this challenge is to put our express.js skills into practice by using routes, GET, POST, and DELETE requests.

## Installation

No installation required, hosted on Heroku

# Usage

On the landing page click "Get Started" to be taken to /notes. Any already saved notes will be shown on the left column and the right side allows for the user to click on existing notes so that the text associated with them may display, or if the user wants to create a new note they can click on the plus on the top right corner which allows the fields to be changed. With a title and body text a save button will also appear on the top right. If the user decided to delete a note, it can be simply done by clicking on the trash can icon directly to the right of the title of the note on the left column.
